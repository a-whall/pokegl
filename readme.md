This project is an application that emulates pokemon gen 1-2 era graphics using low-level OpenGL operations. The app uses the SDL2 library primarily for its cross-platform windowing and IO capabilities, and to provide an OpenGL context. Two library-extensions as well: SDL-image and SDL-mixer for image loading and playing sounds. The other libraries involved are: GLEW, used to expose OpenGL function pointers, and GLM, used for vector and matrix math.
